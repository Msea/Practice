Practice


Okay, so here's the deal. I want practice writing programs, so that's what I'm doing. For now I'm working in Python (this will be updated if that changes).


Here is what's in the repo thus far:

bs = battleship. (Unless that is against some battleship copyright. Please let me know if it is)

p = A game that my friend Rachel taught me. I think it's called Pentagram.


Because I haven't learned all aspects of the language yet, I assume that my code isn't as efficient as it could be. I ask that if you notice something that can be improved you let me know (instead of just editing) to aid in my learning process.




Thank you and enjoy!!
